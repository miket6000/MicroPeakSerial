# MicroPeakSerial

The MicroPeakSerial is heavily based off the design detailed here [https://keithp.com/blogs/MicroPeakSerial/][https://keithp.com/blogs/MicroPeakSerial/] by Keith Packard, but in KiCad rather than geda and including a housing designed in FreeCAD.

The other change is to include a USB A connector instead of the micro B to remove the need for a cable. A USB C connector was considered, but my prefered field laptop is old enough to not have one!
